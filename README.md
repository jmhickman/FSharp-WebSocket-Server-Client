# WebSocket-ServerClient

An exploration of a WebSocket server and client in F#.

The purpose of this project was to learn and create a WebSocket server and client pair that had the following attributes:  

1) Both a server and a client in the same project.  
2) No object programming (Creating a 'Server' type with methods and state and behavior, etc)  
3) No/minimal imperative style (`while` loops)
4) Not an entire framework for making web applications (Saturn, Giraffe, Sauve.io), just the parts I need.
5) Learn `async` workflows and Event programming.
